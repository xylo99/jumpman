Introduction
============

This is an ASCII based machine learning project where players (depicted as stick figures) jump to a point in the console.
New generations are players who have reached the jump at the end of the jump. There are rounds in which every player get a chance to jump.
In each round, the point that the player has to jump to increases. 
It is up to the algorithm to choose an appropriate number from a set so that the height jumped is equal to the point the player need to get to.
